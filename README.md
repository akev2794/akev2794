### This is Aren Kevorkian's Public GitHub Profile

Having recently graduated from university and a Data Science bootcamp, I am currently looking for Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles, with an emphasis on roles in Healthcare and/or Finance. I went to Kingâ€™s College London to pursue a Psychology degree, and discovered a passion for working with Data. I then successfully completed a Data Science bootcamp alongside my final year at university, creating a sign language translation app as part of my final project. Iâ€™m most proficient in Python, capable of using a wide variety of Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning tools, such as Pandas, ScikitLearn, RAPIDS, TensorFlow Keras, and PyTorch. I am also capable in R, SQL, and Googleâ€™s cloud computing services such as Google Compute Engine and BigQuery. As someone who enjoys extracting insights from data, I want to apply my existing skills to solve real-world business challenges. I aim to contribute to a team that values data-driven decision making, continuous learning and innovation, and adaptability.

I would like to connect with Data Analysts, Scientists, and recruiters in this space. Feel free to send me a message on Github to discuss any potential opportunities. Iâ€™m excited to take my first steps in this industry and work with like-minded people to solve todayâ€™s most pressing challenges using data!
